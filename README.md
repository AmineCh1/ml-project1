# Detecting the Higgs Boson (ML project 1)
Here's a quick explanation on how to run the provided code.
##Prerequisites
- The files ```run.py``` and ```implementations.py```should be located in the "scripts" folder.
- The "data" folder should be on the same level as the "scripts" folder.

## Execution
To replicate our submission on AICrowd, simply execute : ``` python run.py```.
(N.B : To actually retrain the model and recompute the optimal hyper-parameters, run ``` python run.py --recompute_params``` ).

## Submission
The submission ``` submission-ridge.csv``` can be found in the "data" folder.
Then, it simply is a matter of uploading the file to AICrowd, but you already knew that I suppose. :)
